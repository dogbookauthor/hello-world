# hello-world
Hi Friends!
On to something new and exciting. Or as I like to call it, "Beginning my journey into the new frontier."
I may need feedback from all of you experts. Be patient. Eventually, I will get the hang of it. 
I come from a literature background. Very excited that coding seems a bit like writing a term paper, but with descriptions about how I want the words and layout to behave. 
I am sure as I get deeper into it, my first impressions will change, but for now, I will humbly begin on this unknown path.
